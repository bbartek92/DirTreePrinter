# DirTreePrinter

Start with *Main.py* file. 

It takes two optional arguments, first is the **-path** you would like to search through, second is the **-level** which controls the depth of the tree (2 for eg. informs that the prodram will search two directories up and two directories down, starting from 'path' location).

**-path** defaults to your current working directory.
**-level** defaults to 3.

Command line interface is based on **argparse** library.
